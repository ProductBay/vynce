      <h2>1. About the Service</h2>

      <h3>1.1 Software Only</h3>
      <p>
        Vynce is a cloud‑based outbound calling and campaign management platform.
        We provide software tools that call centers, sales teams, and other
        organizations can use to run their own campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
        A&apos;Dash does <strong>not</strong> operate as a call center or BPO
        provider, does <strong>not</strong> provide telemarketing services to end
        consumers, and does <strong>not</strong> employ or manage agents who place
        calls on your behalf. You are responsible for your own agents,
        contractors, and end users, and for how they use the Service.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2 Third‑Party Providers</h3>
      <p>
        The Service may integrate with or rely on third‑party communications
        providers (such as telephony/VoIP carriers, SMS providers, cloud
        infrastructure, and payment processors). We do not control and are not
        responsible for third‑party services. Your use of such services may be
        subject to additional terms and policies from those providers.
      </p>
